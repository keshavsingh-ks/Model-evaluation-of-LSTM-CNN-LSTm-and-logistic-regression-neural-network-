1. Image Classification
Project Overview
The Image Classification component of InsightX demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to classify images into various categories. The project explores three different models:

Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer
Deep Neural Network (DNN) Application
Model Descriptions
1. Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
Objective: Introduce the fundamental concepts of neural networks by implementing logistic regression using a neural network approach.
Architecture: A simple neural network with no hidden layers, just input and output layers.
Key Techniques:
Binary classification: Predicting one of two classes.
Sigmoid activation: Used to output a probability between 0 and 1.
Outcome: This model serves as a baseline, highlighting the limitations of logistic regression for complex tasks like image classification.
2. Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer
Objective: Build a basic neural network with one hidden layer to handle more complex classification tasks.
Architecture:
Input layer: Takes in the features.
Hidden layer: Contains multiple neurons with activation functions.
Output layer: Outputs the final classification.
Hyperparameters:
Learning rate: Set to control the speed of convergence.
Activation function: Tanh function used in the hidden layer to introduce non-linearity.
Outcome: Achieved better performance than logistic regression, demonstrating the power of even a simple neural network for more complex data.
3. Deep Neural Network (DNN) Application
Objective: Implement a deeper neural network to further improve classification accuracy.
Architecture:
Multiple hidden layers: Allows the network to learn more complex features.
Activation functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) used in hidden layers, and softmax in the output layer for multi-class classification.
Dropout: Applied to prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameters:
Learning rate: Optimized using a grid search method.
Number of layers: Experimented with different depths to find the optimal architecture.
Batch size and epochs: Tuned for optimal performance.
Outcome: The DNN model significantly outperformed simpler models, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the effectiveness of deeper architectures for image classification.
Real-World Application
This image classification module is applicable in various fields, including:

Medical Imaging: For detecting diseases from X-rays or MRI scans.
Autonomous Vehicles: For identifying objects on the road.
E-commerce: For product categorization based on images.
Results and Evaluation
The DNN model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the preferred choice for complex image classification tasks. The performance of each model is documented in the notebooks, with visualizations of the training process and confusion matrices to illustrate the model's effectiveness.
